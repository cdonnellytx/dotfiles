:: We cannot use a PowerShell script to do it because we have mapped PowerShell scripts on Windows to pwsh.exe, not powershell.exe.
:: Moreover, an alternate file extension doesn't work, because however Chezmoi invokes programs, Windows tries to open the file as an unknown extension (suggesting Notepad among others).
:: So we're left with batch files.
